Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, all the settings for the Q-learning algorithm will be made using layers, variable additions, and methods that have been provided to us. My role involves using this information to create the core of the learning algorithm, where the agent recognizes its environment in each square and performs exploration and exploitation, sending the obtained scores to the Q function.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

As a computer scientist, my task is to organize the application of existing mathematical theorems in this field, and if necessary, update their structures, derive their algorithms, demonstrate their applicability, and conduct tests of these applications.


How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?


My approach to problems as a computer scientist will be multi-layered. First, I will examine the mathematical theorems and research how they can contribute to the solution of my problem. Then, I will modify these theorems for their application to my problem and derive their algorithms. After that, I will implement these algorithms and test both the mathematical models I have prepared and the algorithms themselves.


What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?



As an artificial intelligence developer, we have various ethical responsibilities toward end-users and organizations. First and foremost, we must adhere to the principles of accuracy, security, and transparency to ensure the reliability of the systems we develop. Protecting user data and ensuring privacy, as well as preventing the unethical use of this data, are also significant responsibilities. Additionally, we must be careful to ensure that the decision-making processes of artificial intelligence are fair and non-discriminatory, considering potential side effects. Ensuring that the systems we develop comply with ethical standards will enhance trust in these technologies among users and organizations. Finally, informing users about how artificial intelligence systems work will help them make informed decisions.
